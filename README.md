# Summer 2024 -- KJ Purani

## Introduction
My name is Kshitij Purani, but everyone calls me KJ. The reason? I immigrated from India about 1.5 years ago, and I found that my name can be a bit tricky for people to pronounce here. So, for convenience, KJ it is! I'm a rising senior, and I've been enjoying life in the US, learning new subjects, making friends, and diving into some fascinating biomedical research!

## Summer Activities

### **Solo Adventures in India**

This summer has been a whirlwind of amazing experiences. It started with my first solo trip back to India, where I:
- Reunited with family and friends.
- Explored my hometown and relived old memories.
- Enjoyed authentic Indian cuisine that I missed dearly.

### **USC Bovard Scholars Program**

After returning to the US, I had the incredible opportunity to spend three weeks at the **USC Bovard Scholars Program**. This was a prestigious college prep program, but the real highlight was:
- **Meeting new friends** from all over the USA.
- Engaging in **meaningful discussions** and expanding my perspective on various topics.
- Gaining **valuable insights** into college life and preparation.

## Personal Achievements

### **Research Milestones**

This summer, I achieved several significant milestones in my research. I had four research papers accepted at various conferences, which was a pretty great accomplishment for me. I also had the opportunity to present at the Innovation and Knowledge Conference in Japan, and I’m currently preparing to present my fourth paper in Arizona. These experiences have been pivotal in my journey towards a career in biomedical research, marking important steps forward in my academic and professional development.


## Expectations for This Class

In this AP Computer Science A class, I'm really looking forward to diving deeper into computational science, especially since it’s so important in fields like biology that I love. I’m excited to pick up new skills that I can use in my research, making tech a bigger part of what I do. And of course, I’m aiming to get an A in the class and do well on the AP exam, so I’m ready to take on whatever comes next!

## Tech Projects and Experiences

### **Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) Project**

This summer, I worked on a fascinating project in collaboration with Cedars-Sinai:

**Key Features:**
- Developed a **GCNN** to predict symptoms in hematoma/hemorrhage patients.
- Integrated **unique patient histories** into the software, allowing for accurate tracking and reporting of symptoms such as:
  - Aphasia
  - Headaches
  - Discoloration

This project has been a significant learning experience and has further fueled my passion for computational biology.

## Volunteer Work and Community Services

### **Hunger Free Hearts - California Branch**

This summer, I founded the California branch of the **Hunger Free Hearts Project**. We’ve been actively involved in several meaningful initiatives. One of our key activities includes hosting food drives outside popular locations like Trader Joe's and Costco, where we collect food and donate it to those in need across the state. Additionally, we’ve been providing educational sessions about food insecurity to elementary and middle school students, helping to raise awareness and spread knowledge about this important issue.

In just a few months, our team has grown to over 40 members, and I’m proud of the impact we’re making.
